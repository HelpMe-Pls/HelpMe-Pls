## About Me
- What could I do, that I would do, to make Life a little better? I’ve been asking myself since I started to take my career seriously. The answer to that question announces itself as I found my interest in making things look good.
- I’ve learned that even though I started off relatively untrained, I can do things properly throughout the process of trying to be a responsible person. I noticed that meaningful achievements always require effort along with consistency while taking full advantage of opportunities.
- Making the world a little more high-res.
- Now looking for a 1YOE++ position in frontend/web development.
